htwkimn.theme
==============

This is a responsive Diazo Plone Theme. It's build on top of the responsive Diazo `plonetheme.onegov` product and creates beautiful content representations on desktop and mobile devices. 

It was created in a masters thesis about mobile-friendly Plone websites, that could be developed and maintained by small and fast changing dev-teams and was initially used at the faculty `FIMN <http://imn.htwk-leipzig.de>`_ - a part of the largest university of applied sciences in East Germany.

**Important** this package doesn't work with python 2.6, it requires at least python 2.7


Usage
-----

- Add ``htwkimn.theme`` to your buildout configuration:

::

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        htwkimn.theme

- Install/Activate the generic import profile via extension setup in your site configuration
- Have a look for the resources/dummy-content folder for some content examples


Goals and strategy
------------------

The theme aims for an easy maintainable way to develop a responsive, mobile-friendly website with small or fast-changing teams. Therefore
it's build as child-theme, that can't live without but benefits from the continuing development of
its parent-theme `plonetheme.onegov`. 

It has less code than an individual theme. So you can get an overview about its source code faster, which 
makes it easier for new staff to change the look and feel of the resulting website, especially if they are 
unfamiliar with Plone or Diazo.

To reach that goal, the child-theme extends the parent-theme, adds some Diazo rules to modifiy the parents HTML-structure on the fly and registers some custom SCSS files, to overwrite the original CSS styles.

As you can see, the child brings its own Diazo rules.xml to adapt the Diazo html-template of the parent-theme. Furthermore it brings its own CSS styles to adapt the parents layout as well as its styling.
